	Section 1 "Mesh Portal Service  Reference"

    Service MeshService "_mmm._tcp" "mmm" MeshRequest MeshResponse
		Description
			|Every Mesh Portal Service transaction consists of exactly one
			|request followed by exactly one response.
			|Mesh Service transactions MAY cause modification
			|of the data stored in the Mesh Portal or the Mesh itself
			|but do not cause changes to the connection state. The protocol
			|itself is thus idempotent. There is no set sequence
			|in which operations are required to be performed. It is not
			|necessary to perform a Hello transaction prior to
			|a ValidateAccount, Publish or any other transaction.

	Section 2 "Request Messages"
		Description
			|A Mesh Portal Service request consists of a payload object
			|that inherits from the MeshRequest class. When using the 
			|HTTP binding, the request MUST specify the portal DNS
			|address in the HTTP Host field. 

	Message MeshRequest
		Description
			|Base class for all request messages.
		External Goedel.Protocol.Request
		String Portal
			Description
				|Name of the Mesh Portal Service to which the request 
				|is directed.

	Section 2 "Response Messages"
		Description
			|A Mesh Portal Service response consists of a payload object that
			|inherits from the MeshResponse class. When using the
			|HTTP binding, the response SHOULD
			|report the Status response code in the HTTP response 
			|message. However the response code returned in the
			|payload object MUST always be considered authoritative.

	Message MeshResponse
		External Goedel.Protocol.Response		
		Description
			|Base class for all response messages. Contains only the
			|status code and status description fields.



	Section 2 "Imported Objects"
		Description
			|The Mesh Service protocol makes use of JSON objects
			|defined in the JOSE Signatgure and Encryption specifications.

	Section 2 "Common Structures"
		Description
			|The following common structures are used in the protocol
			|messages:



	Structure KeyValue

			|Describes a Key/Value structure used to make queries
			|for records matching one or more selection criteria.
		String Key
			Description
				|The data retrieval key.

		String Value
			Description

	Structure SearchConstraints
		Description
			|Specifies constraints to be applied to a search result. These 
			|allow a client to limit the number of records returned, the quantity
			|of data returned, the earliest and latest data returned, etc.
		DateTime NotBefore
			Description
				|Only data published on or after the specified time instant 
				|is requested.
		DateTime Before

				|requested. This excludes data published at the specified time instant.
		Integer MaxEntries
			Description
				|Maximum number of data entries to return.
		Integer MaxBytes
			Description
				|Maximum number of data bytes to return.
		String PageKey
			Description
				|Specifies a page key returned in a previous search operation
				|in which the number of responses exceeded the specified bounds.
			Description
				|When a page key is specified, all the other search parameters
				|except for MaxEntries and MaxBytes are ignored and the service
				|returns the next set of data responding to the earlier query.
