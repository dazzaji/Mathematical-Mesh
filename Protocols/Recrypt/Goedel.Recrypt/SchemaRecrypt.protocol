		|Mesh/Recrypt Protocol Schema

	Description 
		|Mesh/Recrypt group administration protocol

	Section 1 "Mesh/Recrypt/Admin Service"
		Description
			|The Mesh/Recrypt administration service supports transactions to 
			|Add and Delete members from a group and to list all the members in a group.

    Service RecryptService "_recrypt._tcp" "recrypt" RecryptRequest RecryptResponse
		Description
			|Every Recrypt Service transaction consists of exactly one
			|request followed by exactly one response.
		Description
			|Mesh Service transactions MAY cause modification
			|of the data stored in the Mesh Portal or the Mesh itself
			|but do not cause changes to the connection state. The protocol
			|itself is thus idempotent. There is no set sequence
			|in which operations are required to be performed. It is not
			|necessary to perform a Hello transaction prior to
			|a CreateGroup, AddMember or any other transaction.



	Section 2 "Request Messages"
		Description
			|A Mesh/Recrypt administration Service request consists of a payload object
			|that inherits from the MeshRequest class. When using the 
			|HTTP binding, the request MUST specify the portal DNS
			|address in the HTTP Host field. 

	Message RecryptRequest
		Description
			|Base class for all request messages.
		External Goedel.Protocol.Request

	Section 2 "Response Messages"
		Description
			|A Mesh/Recrypt administration Service response consists of a payload object that
			|inherits from the MeshResponse class. When using the
			|HTTP binding, the response SHOULD
			|report the Status response code in the HTTP response 
			|message. However the response code returned in the
			|payload object MUST always be considered authoritative.

	Message RecryptResponse
		External Goedel.Protocol.Response		
		Description
			|Base class for all response messages. Contains only the
			|status code and status description fields.


	Section 2 "Imported Objects"
		Description
			|The Recrypt Administration Sercice makes use of JSON objects
			|defined in the JOSE Signatgure and Encryption specifications.

	Section 2 "Common classes"
		Description
			|The following classes are referenced at multiple points in the protocol.


	Section 2 "Administrator Transactions"

    Transaction Admin Hello HelloRequest HelloResponse
		Description
			|Report service and version information. 
		Description
			|The Hello transaction provides a means of determining which protocol
			|versions, message encodings and transport protocols are supported by
			|the service.


    Transaction Admin CreateGroup CreateGroupRequest CreateGroupResponse
		Description
			|Create a new recryption group.


	Message CreateGroupRequest
		Inherits RecryptRequest
		Description
			|Request creation of a recryption group. The only
			|request parameter describes the group to be created.
		Struct RecryptionGroup RecryptionGroup
			Description
				|The Recryption Group to create	

	Message CreateGroupResponse
		Inherits RecryptResponse
		Description
			|Reports the success or failure of a CreateGroup request. The
			|operation either succeeds or fails, there are no returned
			|parameters


    Transaction Admin UpdateGroup UpdateGroupRequest UpdateGroupResponse
		Description
			|Update the information describing a recryption group.


	Message UpdateGroupRequest
		Inherits RecryptRequest
		Description
			|Request an update to a recryption group. 
		Description
			|Note that the update 
			|process is currently limited to 'strike and replace'. This is 
			|likely to become cumbersome if groups with very large numbers 
			|of entries are being maintained. It is likely that a future 
			|version of the protocol will support update requests that
			|implement commonly occurring tasks such as updates to 
			|add a new encryption key, etc.
		Struct RecryptionGroup RecryptionGroup
			Description
				|The Recryption Group to create	

	Message UpdateGroupResponse
		Inherits RecryptResponse
		Description

			|operation either succeeds or fails, there are no returned
			|parameters

			|Request a recryption group record.

	Message GetGroupRequest
		Inherits RecryptRequest
		Description

		Struct RecryptionGroup RecryptionGroup
			Description
				|The Recryption Group to create	


    Transaction Admin AddMember AddMemberRequest AddMemberResponse
		Description
			|Add a member or members to an existing recryption group.

	Message AddMemberRequest
		Inherits RecryptRequest
		Description
			|Add a member to a recryption group (not currently used)
		String RecryptionGroup
			Description
				|The UDF fingerprint of the recryption group to add the member to.
		Struct MemberEntry MemberEntry
			Multiple

		Inherits RecryptResponse
		Description
			|Reports the success or failure of a AddMember request. The
			|operation either succeeds or fails, there are no returned
			|parameters


    Transaction Admin UpdateMember UpdateMemberRequest UpdateMemberResponse
		Description
			|Update a one or more member entries
		Description
			|This transaction may be used to make member entries inactive by 
			|posting REVOKED or SUSPENDED status to their member entry.

	Message UpdateMemberRequest
		Inherits RecryptRequest
		Description
			|Update a recryption group member entry (not currently used)
		String RecryptionGroup
			Description
				|The UDF fingerprint of the recryption group in which the member entries is to be updated
		Struct MemberEntry MemberEntry

				|Describes the member(s) to add

	Message UpdateMemberResponse
		Inherits RecryptResponse
		Description
			|Reports the success or failure of a UpdateMember request. The
			|operation either succeeds or fails, there are no returned
			|parameters

	Section 2 "Future work"
		Description
			|At present the protocol does not provide a mechanism for 
			|modifying administrator privileges or requesting statistics
			|on use of recryption services. These are obviously important.
			|Whether these should be part of the base protocol or a separate
			|protocol is another matter.

	Section 1 "User Service"
		Description
			|The only transaction supported by the user facing service at this point are the ability
			|to request a recryption operation and the ability to request a group encryption
			|key.

    Transaction User GetKey GetKeyRequest GetKeyResponse
		Description
			|Request that the service provide a recryption result for the specified
			|encrypted data and return it encrypted under the user's public key.


	Message GetKeyRequest
		Inherits RecryptRequest
		Description
			|Request the current recryption key for the specified recryption group.
			|NB: At present the group key is NOT authenticated and thus a MITM can
			|perform a key substituition attack. This will be fixed in the next 
			|release.
