               Mesh Confirmation Protocol (Mesh/Confirm)
                   draft-hallambaker-mesh-confirm-00

Abstract

   Mesh Confirmation Protocol (Mesh/Confirm) is a three-party Web 
   Service that supports a transactional second factor confirmation 
   mechanism that provides a superset of the capabilities of traditional
   second factor authentication schemes. The three parties in the 
   protocol are Enquirer who posts a confirmation request, a Responder 
   who may or may not respond to the request and the Broker where the 
   requests and responses are posted.

Internet-Draft                Mesh/Confirm                     June 2017

1. Background

   Authentication of end users is one of the biggest challenges for 
   Internet and Web security today. Despite an abundance of technology 
   that offers authentication mechanisms that are more robust, more 
   secure and easier to use, the default mechanism for user 
   authentication is the use of usernames and passwords.

   Unlike traditional schemes, Mesh/Confirm is designed for 
   implementation on a device that has at least the capabilities of a 
   modern 'smartphone'. In particular, a Mesh/Confirm client device MUST
   support a means of presenting text output to and accepting text input
   from the user and an Internet connection.

   While mobile devices offering this degree of functionality were rare 
   in 2007, they have since become ubiquitous. In addition to 
   smartphones, many users now carry smart watches and the class of 
   wearable electronics is expected to expand further in years to come. 
   It is thus now a practical proposition for a site requiring second 
   factor authentication to support at least a part of its users using a
   technology that requires such affordances. 

1.1. Second Factor Authentication

   Second factor authentication mechanisms offer greater security over 
   the use of passwords alone by combining a first factor (typically a 
   password) with a second factor, typically a biometric or proof of 
   possession of a physical token.

   Traditional second factor authentication techniques have suffered 
   from the need to distribute physical tokens and the difficulty of 
   ensuring that a biometric authentication is presented to a 
   trustworthy terminal.

   The usability of traditional second factor authentication techniques 
   has been poor or worse. Even the simplest scheme in which the user is
   required to read in a 'one time use' numeric code from the 
   authentication token device and enter it into a password field. While
   such operations are relatively simple they require the user to engage
   in a sequence of operations that bears no necessary or natural 
   relationship to the underlying task for which the authentication is 
   required.

   Nor does the act of engaging in a traditional second factor scheme 
   offer proof of anything other than that the user was authenticated. 
   Any correspondence between the act of authentication and the purpose 
   for which the authentication was provided must be maintained 
   separately.

1.2. Confirmation vs. Authentication

   A confirmation service addresses by cryptographically binding 
   responses to the request that they reply to.

   A confirmation service allows the user experience to be precisely 
   matched to the action that the user is attempted. This is simpler and
   more secure than a traditional second factor authentication scheme. 
   Instead of being asked to read a random number from one device and 
   enter it into another, the user is asked if they really want to 
   perform the action for which authentication is requested.

   A confirmation service offers better accountability for end users 
   than a traditional second factor authentication scheme. An 
   authentication service only provides an assertion that the user was 
   present. A confirmation service provides an assertion that the user 
   was present and that they confirmed (or refused) a specific request.

   For example, Alice has been granted access to a machine storing 
   classified data. If an authentication service is used for access 
   control, the authentication service log will only record the dates 
   and times that Alice accessed the system. to find out if Alice 
   accessed a particular file on a particular day it is necessary to 
   consult and correlate both the authentication log of the system and 
   the activity log for the application.

   If instead a confirmation service is used the confirmation log 
   contains an authenticated record of both the authentication events 
   and the transactions for which the authentication was requested.

1.3. Use Scenarios

   A confirmation service complements rather than replaces a traditional
   authentication scheme. Providing a highly secure and convenient means
   of authenticating requests that carry a high degree of risk mitigates
   the risk of using convenient but intrinsically low security 
   techniques for other actions.

1.4. Use in Financial Services

   If an attacker is to profit from breaching an account with a 
   financial service such as a bank or a brokerage they must find a way 
   to move money out of the account. Thus, adding bill payment 
   recipients, initiating wire transfers and trading in low volume 
   'penny stocks' represent high risk activities.

   For example: Bank of Ethel might permit customers to use a simple 
   username and password scheme to gain access to their account to check
   their balance or to send payments to existing recipients but require 
   use of the second factor confirmation device for a high-risk 
   transaction such as adding a new payee or making a substantially

Internet-Draft                Mesh/Confirm                     June 2017

   higher payment than normal.

1.5. Machine Binding

   A second factor confirmation service may be combined with a machine 
   level authentication scheme to permit a transparent form of 
   authentication for low risk transactions.

   For example: Alice stores her low risk authentication credentials 
   (e.g. usernames and passwords) using a 'cloud' service. When she 
   wishes to use those credentials an agent on her personal machine 
   fetches credentials from the cloud service as necessary. When Alice 
   wishes to access a site from a different machine she receives a 
   confirmation request on her mobile device to grant access from that 
   machine.

   Use of such a mechanism is clearly more satisfactory when suitable 
   cryptographic protocols such as SAML or Kerberos are employed to 
   limit the disclosure and hence possible compromise of the 
   credentials. The specification of such protocols is outside the scope
   of this document.

1.6. Tethered Use

   Although Mesh/Confirm is designed for use in a three-party scenario, 
   there are situations in which a two party mode may be preferred.

   For example: Bob is a roadwarrior who requires access to confidential
   documents stored on his laptop device from anywhere in the world, 
   including locations where Internet access is not possible. To permit 
   access in such circumstances, Bob's Mesh/Confirm client supports use 
   of a tethered mode in which the mobile device is connected via 
   Bluetooth or plugged into his laptop via a USB port.

   For example: Carol is a network manager of a large computing facility
   that uses Mesh/Confirm to authenticate and track all changes to 
   critical resources. Since Mesh/Confirm is itself a network resource a
   bootstrap consideration arises: How can Carol confirm her network 
   configuration requests using Mesh/Confirm when the network itself is 
   down? Support for a tethered mode in which the Mesh/Confirm device 
   communicates via USB or similar wired protocol allows this use case 
   to be supported.

   While availability of a tethered mode is clearly essential if 
   Mesh/Confirm is to be used in certain applications, support for this 
   feature outside the scope of this version of the specification.

1.7. Co-Browser

   While Mesh/Confirm is designed for deployment on a secondary device, 
   deployment on the same device as the one for which confirmation is 
   being requested is also possible and can provide security benefits.

   Modern Web browsers are large and complex with many features such as 
   support for mobile code that are incompatible with a high security 
   environment. Separating the confirmation protocol from the Web 
   Browsing protocol permits implementation in a minimal client designed
   to permit detailed security analysis. Such a client might be embedded
   in or support means of secure interaction with a trustworthy 
   operating system component.

   While this means of deployment does not provide a true second factor 
   confirmation, it is likely to provide a sufficient degree of 
   authentication for many transactions.

2. Architecture

   Mesh/Confirm is a Web Service that permits an Enquirer to request 
   that a User confirm or reject a specified action. If the user 
   responds, the response is signed with a digital signature under a key
   that is unique to the user account, the client and the device.

2.1. Parties

   Each Mesh/Confirm protocol interaction takes place between a 
   connection pair of the following parties:

   Enquirer

   A party that initiates a confirmation request.

   User

   The User is the person being asked to grant or refuse confirmation. A
   User MAY have multiple accounts with multiple Broker Services.

   User Device

   A device that the user has bound to their broker account.

   Broker

   A clearing house that stores and forwards requests from Initiators to
   Users Device and responses from Users to Initiators. The Broker is 
   only trusted to perform routing filtering and recording of requests 
   and responses. The Broker is not trusted with respect to the 
   responses returned.

2.2. Accounts

   Users are identified by means of an account identifier. The display 
   presentation of an account identifier is the form of an RFC2822 email
   address identifier without the enclosing angle braces, for example:

   alice@example.com

   The account identifier is used by the User when registering the use 
   of the confirmation service with a Broker.

2.3. Open and Closed Services

   A Mesh/Confirm service MAY be Open or Closed. An Open service 
   provider provides Mesh/Confirm service to the general public. A 
   Closed service provider only provides service to a specific 
   community.

   For example: An Internet Service Provider or DNS Registrar might 
   provide an open Mesh/Confirm service as a part of their standard 
   service offering to customers. An employer might operate a closed 
   Mesh/Confirm service to be used for company business.

3. Simple Request Markup Language (SRMLv1)

   Confirmation requests are posted in SRML, a deliberately limited 
   subset of HTML. SRML is limited to four elements and one attribute. 
   These are:

   The top-level element for an SRML request

   Heading

   Running text

   Paragraph

   User option

   Button specifying a value that the user can select.

   While SRML is loosely based on the HTML forms markup, there are 
   important differences. The HTML markup model supports multiple 
   document types of which forms are only one and a single document may 
   contain multiple forms with multiple different action values. In an 
   SRML document is a single form and the form action to be performed is
   impicit in the presentation of the document to the user.

4.1. XML Schema and Content Type Identifier

   The MIME Content Type and schema identifier for SRML are

   Content-Type

   text/xml 

   xmlns

   http://hallambaker.com/Schemas/srml.xsd

   The schema is

   include=Schemas\srml.md

4.2. Design considerations and future options

   The capabilities of SRML are intentionally limited to the bare 
   minimum. It should be possible to make use of SRML to display options
   to the user on a smartwatch or other device with a highly constrained
   display.

   The function of the confirmation service is to provide confirmation 
   of an action that was initiated elsewhere. It is therefore 
   inappropriate for this or any future version of SRML to offer 
   extensive data entry or validation capabilities. SRML applications 
   MUST NOT support any form of scripting or active code extensions to 
   SRML content.

Internet-Draft                Mesh/Confirm                     June 2017

   It might prove advantageous in the future to extend the input types 
   to include simple form elements such as checkboxes, numeric fields, 
   text choices and possibly free form text.

5. Request Authentication and Authorization

   The current version of the protocol does not address the question of 
   how service requests are to be authorized or authenticated.

   A triple lock security approach is anticipated in which cryptographic
   enhancements are applied at three separate levels to provide 
   different security controls:

   Transport Layer

   Basic confidentiality and integrity controls are provided using TLS 
   with a server side certificate. It is necessary to provide encryption
   at this layer to protect confidentiality of meta-data.

   Presentation Layer

   Mutual authentication of the client and service is provided at the 
   presentation layer. In the default JWB binding, this is provided 
   within the HTTP content payload. The use of encryption at the 
   presentation is optional.

   Data Layer

   Confirmation requests and responses are signed by the Enquirer and 
   Responder respectively. This provides for non-repudiation of 
   messages. 

5.1. Service Authentication

   Since the responder is identified by the responder's account, Minimal
   Validation is sufficient but Domain Validation is preferred. These 
   credentials MAY be bound using a strong DNS name.

5.2. Responder Authentication

   The responder is authenticated by means of the user's Mesh profile.

   The ability to delegate access to a confirmation account might be 
   useful in certain circumstances. 

5.3. Enquirer Authentication

   Authentication of the Enquirer presents very different challenges to 
   authentication of the Service or the Responder as it is the only part
   of the service that is 'open'. It is thus likely to be the target of 
   abuse (i.e. spam). It is therefore important that the authentication 



Hallam-Baker           Expires December 26, 2017                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                Mesh/Confirm                     June 2017

   mechanism enable appropriate authorization and accountability 
   strategies.

   For example, one strategy to control abuse might be to permit 
   enquirers to post requests if they were signed with a key 
   authenticated by an Extended Validation certificate or were sent by 
   an enquirer approved by the responder to whom the request was 
   directed. In the first case, abuse is mitigated by an accountability 
   control, in the second by explicit authorization of the sender.

   While it is possible to implement such a strategy in the responder 
   application, this approach is clearly limiting. Filtering of messages
   in the service avoids the need to synchronize policy across the 
   user's confirmation devices and protects possibly limited wireless 
   bandwidth by performing policy enforcement in the service rather than
   the responder's device.

   Mesh/Confirm does not provide a mechanism for specifying such a 
   security policy. Leaving this requirement to a separate service 
   allows for a protocol that can specify policy for multiple modes of 
   communication. For instance, a customer of a bank might permit the 
   bank to send confirmation messages and to deliver statements by email
   but not to make contact by voice or video calls.

6. Security Considerations

   Consider spam control, how do users prevent unwanted requests? (EV 
   accreditation, filtering at Broker)

   People deploying Mesh/Confirm as a means of controlling access to 
   networking infrastructure must consider the bootstrap issue. In 
   particular since Mesh/Confirm requires Internet access the network 
   administrator must ensure that it is possible to manage the network 
   resources necessary to support an SXS service when that service is 
   down.
