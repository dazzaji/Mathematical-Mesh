<h2>Initial Key Exchange Example

Alice requests access to a service using her account identifier #{Example.AccountID}.
She has already registered her Mesh personal profile with the service where it is bound
to her account identifier as the corresponding credential.

The Key exchange request is:

#{Point.Messages[0].String()}

The Keyu Exchange response is

#{Point.Messages[1].String()}

Note that the example has the witness value but does not authenticate the signed 
result at present. Perhaps it would be better to create the witness value from the 
ticket data which eliminates the need for authenticating the response??
